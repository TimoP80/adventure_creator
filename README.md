# adventurecreator

Simple text based adventure game engine

This project contains three executables: 



acengine.exe for running the game files (.agf)

accompiler.exe for compiling xml files to agf

AdventureCreatorIDE.exe for editing game files and saving them to xml format

The source code is compilable with Delphi 10 Seattle and above. Compiled binaries are provided and they are
updated regularly.

WARNING! This project is not documented yet, documentation is a work in progress as the engine is 
being developed to its full form.
